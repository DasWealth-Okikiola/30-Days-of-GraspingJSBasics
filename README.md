#30 Days of JavaScript Fundamentals

#The Discipline Phase

This repository documents my first 30 days in backend engineering—before frameworks, before servers, before Node.js. I refused to skip the foundations. This is a collection of logical problems, simulations, and fundamental concepts that are now the engine of my Node/Express systems.

#What I Mastered:

Loops and Nested Conditions (The logical building blocks)

High-Order Functions (map(), filter(), reduce())

Complex Object & Method manipulation

Simulations: ATM Systems, Bank Logic, Rocket Launch Sequences
